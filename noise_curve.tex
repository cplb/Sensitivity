\title{Gravitational wave sensitivity curves}
\author{Christopher Moore}
\address{Institute of Astronomy, Madingley Road, Cambridge, CB3 0HA, UK}
\ead{cjm96@ast.cam.ac.uk}

\begin{abstract}
There are many conventions in use by the gravitational wave community to describe the amplitude of sources and the sensitivity of detectors. Here a summary and a disambiguation of these conventions is attempted. Sensitivity curves plots for each of the conventions are presented.
