\title{The full spectrum of gravitational wave sensitivity curves}

\begin{abstract}
\emph{When discussing the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors there are several common conventions. These are frequently confused. We outline the merits of and differences between the various quantities used for parameterizing noise curves and characterizing gravitational wave amplitudes. We conclude by producing plots that consistently compare different detectors.}
