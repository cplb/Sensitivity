\section{Concluding remarks}\label{sec:discussion}
As much frequency variation exists for GWs as exists in the electromagnetic spectrum, and a great variety of ingenious GW detectors have been designed and constructed. Trying to summarise an entire field of astronomy on one plot is an impossible task; however we hope that the figures and analysis presented here provide useful insight.
